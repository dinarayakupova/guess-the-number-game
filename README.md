# Number Guessing Game

## Description:
This project, "Number Guessing Game" is an interactive web application where users try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 20, competing against the computer. 

## Features:
* User Input Validation: Ensures that the user enters a valid number within the specified range (1 to 20) and handles non-numeric inputs gracefully.
* Dynamic Feedback: Provides hints to the user to guess higher or lower based on their input compared to the computerâ€™s number.
* Winning Condition: Notifies the user with a celebratory message and image if they guess the number correctly.
* DOM Manipulation: Demonstrated the ability to interact with the DOM to read input values, trigger functions on user actions, and dynamically update content.
* Event Handling: Enhanced understanding of JavaScript event handling by responding to user actions such as button clicks and key presses.

## Technologies Used:
*	HTML for the structural foundation of the application.
*	CSS for styling and animations.
*	JavaScript for game logic and DOM manipulation.
*	GSAP for animations.
*	SweetAlert2 for enhanced user alerts.
